\comment{
In this paper, the authors suggest the followings

\begin{itemize}
\item we provide a review of literature about autonomy and especially collective autonomy in MASs;
\item we analyse the aggregate computing framework by the perspective of autonomy, by covering its positioning w.r.t. individual and collective autonomy, and showing how it can supports adjustable autonomy;
\item we exemplify the discussion through a simulated case study, investigating (i) the relationship between individual goals/autonomy and collective goals/autonomy; and (ii) the relationship between structures and collective autonomy; and Ã¹
\item we provide gaps in literature on programming reliable collective autonomy and delineate a research roadmap.
\end{itemize}
This paper is generally well-written, but needs some supplements.
}
\reply{ Thanks for the appreciation and for the suggestions, that we have carefully considered to carry out the current revision. }

\comment{
=\textgreater There are many types of 'autonomy'. It is better for the author to summarize and show them in a table.
}
\action{ 
A new table, \Cref{main:table:autonomy-notions}, has been added to summarise the various notions of autonomy that have been mentioned in the manuscript.
}


\comment{
=\textgreater In the simulation results, there are some cases where p \textless 1 is better. What does this mean?. 
In addition, there seems to be a need for more simulations to support the proposition.
}
\reply{ 
Thanks for pointing out this aspect of the results, which needs a clarification.

Further experiments have revealed that the differences 
 highlighted in curves are not significant (i.e., they are due to a ``sampling error'').
 Essentially, the metric ``healed count'' should not be considered absolutely but rather relatively to the number of problems to be solved that emerge.
 In other words, the ``healed count'' can only be considered as an approximation of the system performance, which is better described by other means (see below).
}
\action{ 
We added a measure of error that summarily represents the performance of a simulation run in \Cref{main:sb:performance}. 
 We ran another simulation with healer count = 8 to show that as healer count increases,
 performance differences increase.
 The error was described using a bar chart (\Cref{main:fig:stack-plot-error}) and we 
 added a discussion regarding the raised issue in \Cref{main:sb:results}.
%{\color{red} Hence, we have deduced that the healer count curves
% give only a qualitative measure of system performance. 
% So a few deviations in plots does not mean that one configuration is better than another. 
% Indeed, if we check the results using the error metric in the experiment with healer count = 6,
% p = 1 perform substantially equal to p = 0.75. 
% But, increasing healer count (therefore having an increasing need of collective choices) p = 1 
% starts to deviate considerably from p = 0.75 configuration (both in qualitative and quantitative trend).

%\say{MV}{ALL}{I would add a very brief description of what happens actually (3-4 lines)}
%\say{RC}{MV}{Do you meant in the paper or in the response? I think the former. @GA the red part is more a discussion than a description of the ``action'' to address the comment (which is better to keep short).}
