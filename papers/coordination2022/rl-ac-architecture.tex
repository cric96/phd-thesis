  %
  The \ac{rl} state and reward concepts build upon the context, given by environment and neighbour data. 
  %
  The designer configures action points where learning can improve the aggregate computation. 
  %
  The actions selected by the learned policies will then affect the environment (via actuators) and neighbours (via outbound messages).}
