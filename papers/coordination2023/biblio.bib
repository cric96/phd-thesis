abstract = {In the Markov decision process (MDP) formalization of reinforcement learning, a single adaptive agent interacts with an environment defined by a probabilistic transition function. In this solipsis-tic view, secondary agents can only be part of the environment and are therefore fixed in their behavior. The framework of Markov games allows us to widen this view to include multiple adaptive agents with interacting or competing goals. This paper considers a step in this direction in which exactly two agents with diametrically opposed goals share an environment. It describes a Q-learning-like algorithm for finding optimal policies and demonstrates its application to a simple two-player game in which the optimal policy is probabilistic.}

abstract = {We present an efficient implementation of a high performance parallel framework for Agent Based Modelling (ABM), exploiting the parallel architecture of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It provides a mapping between formal agent specifications, with C based scripting, and optimised NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) code. The mapping of agent data structures and agent communication is described, and our work is evaluated through a number of simple interacting agent examples. In contrast with an alternative, single machine CPU implementation, a speedup of up to 250 times is reported.},
