abstract = "Cyber–physical systems increasingly feature highly-distributed and mobile deployments of devices spread over large physical environments: in these contexts, it is generally very difficult to engineer trustworthy critical services, mostly because formal methods generally hardly scale with the number of involved devices, especially when faults, continuous changes, and dynamic topologies are the norm. To start addressing this problem, in this paper we devise a formally correct and self-adaptive implementation of distributed monitors for spatial properties. We start from the Spatial Logic of Closure Spaces, and provide a compositional translation that takes a formula and yields a distributed program that provides runtime verification of its validity. Such programs are expressed in terms of the field calculus, a recently emerged computational model that focusses on global-level outcomes instead of single-device behaviour, and expresses distributed computations by pure functions and the functional composition mechanism. By reusing previous results and tools of the field calculus, we prove correctness of the translation, self-stabilisation of the derived monitors, and empirically evaluate adaptivity of such monitors in a realistic smart city scenario of safe crowd monitoring and control."

abstract={Objective:To assess the psychological impact of a mass casualty incident (MCI) in a subset of personnel in a level I hospital.Methods:Emergency department staff responded to an MCI in June 2017 in Turin, Italy by an unexpected sudden surge of casualties following a stampede (mass escape). Participants completed the Psychological Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment Responder Self-Triage System (PsySTART-R), which classified the potential risk of psychological distress in “no risk” versus “at risk” categorization and identified a range of impacts aggregated for the population of medical responders. Participants were administered a questionnaire on the perceived effectiveness of management of the MCI. Two months later, the participants were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5).Results:The majority of the responders were classified as “no risk” by the PsySTART-R; no significant differences on HADS, K6, and PCL-5 were found in the participants grouped by the PsySTART-R categories. The personnel acquainted to work in emergency contexts (emergency department and intensive care unit) scored significantly lower in the HADS than the personnel usually working in other wards. The number of positive PsySTART-R criteria correlated with the HADS depression score.Conclusions:Most of the adverse psychological implications of the MCI were well handled and averted by the responders. A possible explanation could be related to factors such as the clinical condition of the victims (most were not severely injured, no fatalities), the small number of casualties (87) brought to the hospital, the event not being considered life-threatening, and its brief duration, among others. Responders had mainly to cope with a sudden surge in casualties and with organizational issues.},

abstract = "In software engineering, knowledge about recurrent problems, along with blueprints of associated solutions for diverse design contexts, are often captured in so-called design patterns. Identifying design patterns is particularly valuable for novel and still largely unexplored application contexts such as the Internet of Things, Cyber–Physical Systems, and Edge Computing, as it would help keeping a balanced trade-off between generality and applicability, guiding the mainstream development of language mechanisms, algorithms, architectures, and supporting platforms. Based on recurrence of related solutions found in the literature, in this work we present a design pattern for self-adaptive systems, named Self-organising Coordination Regions (SCR): its goal is to organise a process of interconnecting devices into teams, to solve local tasks in cooperation. Specifically, it is a decentralised coordination pattern for partitioned integration and coordination of devices, which relies on continuous adaptivity to context change to provide resilient distributed decision-making in large-scale situated systems. It leverages the divide-and-conquer principle, partitioning (in a self-organising fashion) the network of devices into regions, where internal coordination activities are regulated via feedback/control flows among leaders and subordinate nodes. We present the pattern, provide a template implementation in the Aggregate Computing framework, and evaluate it through simulation of two case studies in edge computing and hierarchical, heterogeneous networks."

    abstract = { This study compared the pace of life in large cities from 31 countries around the world. Three indicators of pace of life were observed: average walking speed in downtown locations, the speed with which postal clerks completed a simple request (work speed), and the accuracy of public clocks. Overall, pace of life was fastest in Japan and the countries of Western Europe and was slowest in economically undeveloped countries. The pace was significantly faster in colder climates, economically productive countries, and in individualistic cultures. Faster places also tended to have higher rates of death from coronary heart disease, higher smoking rates, and greater subjective well-being. Discussion focuses on how the pace of life is intertwined with the social-psychological and community characteristics of a culture, and the central role of pace of life in defining the personality of a place and its people. }

abstract = {Macroprogramming refers to the theory and practice of expressing the macro(scopic) behaviour of a collective system using a single program. Macroprogramming approaches are motivated by the need of effectively capturing global/system-level aspects and the collective behaviour of multiple computational components, while abstracting over low-level details. Previously, this programming style had been primarily adopted to describe the data-processing logic in sensor networks; recently, research forums on spatial computing, collective systems, and the Internet of Things have provided renewed interest in macro-approaches. However, related contributions are still fragmented and lack conceptual consistency. Therefore, to foster principled research, an integrated view of the field is provided, together with opportunities and challenges.},

abstract="In the previous chapters, we have focused on the construction of external domain-specific languages. Their development follows a compiler-like pipeline architecture, with clearly separated design artifacts: concrete and abstract syntax, types and constraints, an interpreter or a generator. Building external DSLs might feel like reimplementing large parts of GPL functionality, especially if your DSL includes logic or expressions, or you need an editor with support for static checking, code completion, etc.",
