ABSTRACT = {The engineering of large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) increasingly relies on principles from self-organisation and collective computing, enabling these systems to cooperate and adapt in dynamic environments. CPS engineering also often leverages digital twins that provide synchronised logical counterparts of physical entities. In contrast, sensor networks rely on the different but related concept of virtual device that provides an abstraction of a group of sensors. In this work, we study how such concepts can contribute to the engineering of self-organising CPSs. To that end, we analyse the concepts and devise modelling constructs, distinguishing between identity correspondence and execution relationships. Based on this analysis, we then contribute to the novel concept of &ldquo;collective digital twin&rdquo; (CDT) that captures the logical counterpart of a collection of physical devices. A CDT can also be &ldquo;augmented&rdquo; with purely virtual devices, which may be exploited to steer the self-organisation process of the CDT and its physical counterpart. We underpin the novel concept with experiments in the context of the pulverisation framework of aggregate computing, showing how augmented CDTs provide a holistic, modular, and cyber-physically integrated system view that can foster the engineering of self-organising CPSs.},

abstract = {Various performance benefits such as low latency and high bandwidth have turned fog computing into a well-accepted extension of the cloud computing paradigm. Many fog computing systems have been proposed so far, consisting of distributed compute nodes which are often organized hierarchically in layers. To achieve low latency, these systems commonly rely on the assumption that the nodes of adjacent layers reside close to each other. However, this assumption may not hold in fog computing systems that span over large geographical areas, due to the wide distribution of the nodes. To avoid relying on this assumption, in this paper we design distributed algorithms whereby the compute nodes measure the network proximity to each other, and self-organize into a hierarchical or a flat structure accordingly. Moreover, we implement these algorithms on geographically distributed compute nodes, and we experiment with image processing and smart city use cases. Our results show that compared to alternative methods, the proposed algorithms decrease the communication latency of latency-sensitive processes by 27%–43%, and increase the available network bandwidth by 36%–86%. Furthermore, we analyze the scalability of our algorithms, and we show that a flat structure (i.e., without layers) scales better than the commonly used layered hierarchy due to generating less overhead when the size of the system grows.}

of socio-technical systems that combine, in a coordinated way, the strengths of humans,
machines and collectives in terms of competences, knowledge and problem solving capabilities
with the communication, computing and storage capabilities of advanced ICT. Social
Collective Intelligence opens a number of challenges for researchers in both computer
science and social sciences; at the same time it provides an innovative approach to
solve challenges in diverse application domains, ranging from health to education
and organization of work. The book will provide a cohesive and holistic treatment
of Social Collective Intelligence, including challenges emerging in various disciplines
(computer science, sociology, ethics) and opportunities for innovating in various
application areas. By going through the book the reader will gauge insight and knowledge
into the challenges and opportunities provided by this new, exciting, field of investigation.
Benefits for scientists will be in terms of accessing a comprehensive treatment of
the open research challenges in a multidisciplinary perspective. Benefits for practitioners
and applied researchers will be in terms of access to novel approaches to tackle relevant
problems in their field. Benefits for policy-makers and public bodies representatives
will be in terms of understanding how technological advances can support them in supporting
the progress of society and economy.}

title = {Principles of Systems Science},
year = {2014},
isbn = {1493919199},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
abstract = {This pioneering text provides a comprehensive introduction to systems structure, function,
and modeling as applied in all fields of science and engineering. Systems understanding
is increasingly recognized as a key to a more holistic education and greater problem
solving skills, and is also reflected in the trend toward interdisciplinary approaches
to research on complex phenomena. While the concepts and components of systems science
will continue to be distributed throughout the various disciplines, undergraduate
degree programs in systems science are also being developed, including at the authors
own institutions. However, the subject is approached, systems science as a basis for
understanding the components and drivers of phenomena at all scales should be viewed
with the same importance as a traditional liberal arts education. Principles of Systems
Science contains many graphs, illustrations, side bars, examples, and problems to
enhance understanding. From basic principles of organization, complexity, abstract
representations, and behavior (dynamics) to deeper aspects such as the relations between
information, knowledge, computation, and system control, to higher order aspects such
as auto-organization, emergence and evolution, the book provides an integrated perspective
on the comprehensive nature of systems. It ends with practical aspects such as systems
analysis, computer modeling, and systems engineering that demonstrate how the knowledge
of systems can be used to solve problems in the real world. Each chapter is broken
into parts beginning with qualitative descriptions that stand alone for students who
have taken intermediate algebra. The second part presents quantitative descriptions
that are based on pre-calculus and advanced algebra, providing a more formal treatment
for students who have the necessary mathematical background. Numerous examples of
systems from every realm of life, including the physical and biological sciences,
humanities, social sciences, engineering, pre-med and pre-law, are based on the fundamental
systems concepts of boundaries, components as subsystems, processes as flows of materials,
energy, and messages, work accomplished, functions performed, hierarchical structures,
and more. Understanding these basics enables further understanding both of how systems
endure and how they may become increasingly complex and exhibit new properties or
characteristics. Serves as a textbook for teaching systems fundamentals in any discipline
or for use in an introductory course in systems science degree programs Addresses
a wide range of audiences with different levels of mathematical sophistication Includes
open-ended questions in special boxes intended to stimulate integrated thinking and
class discussion Describes numerous examples of systems in science and society Captures
the trend towards interdisciplinary research and problem solving}

abstract = {Akka is a Scala-based toolkit that simplifies developing concurrent distributed applications.
Perfect for high-volume applications that need to scale rapidly, Akka is an efficient
foundation for event-driven systems that want to scale elastically up and out on demand,
both on multi-core processors and across server nodes. Akka in Action is a comprehensive
tutorial on building message-oriented systems using Akka. The book takes a hands-on
approach, where each new concept is followed by an example that shows how it works,
how to implement the code, and how to test it. Readers will explore a message-oriented
event-driven application in Akka and also tackle key issues like how to model immutable
messages and domain models, and apply patterns like Event Sourcing, and CQRS. The
book concludes with practical advice on how to tune and customize a system built with
Akka. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats

abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to bring many benefits, including increased productivity, reduced costs, and increased safety to new generation manufacturing plants. The main ingredients of IIoT are the connected, communicating devices directly located in the workshop floor (far edge devices), as well as edge gateways that connect such devices to the Internet and, in particular, to cloud servers. The field of Edge Computing advocates that keeping computations as close as possible to the sources of data can be an effective means of reducing latency, preserving privacy, and improve the overall efficiency of the system. However, building systems where (far) edge and cloud nodes cooperate is quite challenging. In the present work we propose the adoption of the Aggregate Programming (AP) paradigm (and, in particular, the “aggregate process” construct) as a way to simplify building distributed, intelligent services at the far edge of an IIoT architecture. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the approach with simulated experiments on FCPP (a C++ library for AP), and with some basic experiments on physical IIoT boards running an ad-hoc porting of FCPP.}
