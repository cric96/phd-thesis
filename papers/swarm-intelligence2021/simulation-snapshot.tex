  \caption[Snapshots of simulation executions during the sensing-driven clustering.]{Snapshots of simulation executions. 
  The colour of the square identifies the cluster ID found in that point. 
  Black colour means no cluster. 
  The green circle means that the node is a candidate. 
  The blue gradient circles are a graphical representation of temperature distribution. 
  On the left is shown a snapshot of a simulation before the merge policy has been applied (multiple clusters per point are found). 
  On the right, there is the snapshot of the same simulation after the merge policy action.}
