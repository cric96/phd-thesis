  abstract  = "PurposeThe Group of Unmanned Assistant Robots Deployed in
               Aggregative Navigation by Scent (GUARDIANS) multi‐robot team is
               to be deployed in a large warehouse in smoke. The team is to
               assist firefighters search the warehouse in the event or danger
               of a fire. The large dimensions of the environment together with
               development of smoke which drastically reduces visibility,
               represent major challenges for search and rescue operations. The
               GUARDIANS robots act alongside a firefighter and guide and
               accompany the firefighters on the site while indicating possible
               obstacles and the locations of danger and maintain
               communications links. The purpose of this paper is to focus on
               basic navigation behaviours of multi‐robot or human‐robot teams,
               which have to be achieved without central and on‐line control in
               both categories of GUARDIANS robots'
               tasks.Design/methodology/approachIn order to fulfill the
               aforementioned tasks, the robots need to be able to perform
               certain behaviours. Among the basic behaviours are capabilities
               to stay together as a group, that is, generate a formation and
               navigate while keeping this formation. The control model used to
               generate these behaviours is based on the so‐called social
               potential field framework, which the authors adapt to the
               specific tasks required for the GUARDIANS scenario. All tasks
               can be achieved without central control, and some of the
               behaviours can be performed without explicit communication
               between the robots.FindingsThe GUARDIANS environment requires
               flexible formations of the robot team: the formation has to
               adapt itself to the circumstances. Thus, the application has
               forced the concept of a formation to be re‐defined. Using the
               graph‐theoretic terminology, it can be said that a formation may
               be stretched out as a path or be compact as a star or wheel. The
               developed behaviours have been implemented in simulation
               environments as well as on real ERA‐MOBI robots commonly
               referred to as Erratics. Advantages and shortcomings of the
               model, based on the simulations as well as on the implementation
               with a team of Erratics are discussed.Originality/valueThis
               paper discusses the concept of a robot formation in the context
               of a real world application of a robot team (Swarm).",
