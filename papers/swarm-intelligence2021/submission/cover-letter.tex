\maketitle

Dear \emph{Editors},

we would like to submit our manuscript entitled ``\theTitle{}''
to the \thePublisher{} Journal on \theJournal{}, Special Issue on ``\theSI{}''.

This work proposes a field-based meta-algorithm
 for dynamic sensing-driven mobile swarm clustering.
%
It leverages the field-based computing paradigm~\cite{DBLP:journals/jlap/ViroliBDACP19} and recent developments like ``aggregate processes''~\cite{DBLP:journals/eaai/CasadeiVAPD21} to express and promote self-organising behaviour
 resulting in the creation of ``clustering fields''
 that map individual agents of a swarm to a cluster,
 doing so while taking into account the data perceived in the environment
 as well as the spatial distance between the agents.
%
The proposed meta-algorithm is evaluated through simulation.
%
The source code and simulation environment, together with configuration, data, and instructions for reproducibility,
 have been made publicly available.
%

Given the relevance to the special issue, 
 the significance of the contribution,
 and the quality of the presentation,
 we believe this manuscript
 well fits this venue.

We also hereby declare that:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item This manuscript is the authors' original work and has not been published nor has it been submitted simultaneously elsewhere.
\item All authors have checked the manuscript and have agreed to the submission. 
\end{itemize}
