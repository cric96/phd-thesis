\begin{abstract}	
This thesis addresses the burgeoning field of Cyber-Physical Social Systems (CPSWs), 
 which are large-scale ensembles of locally interacting computational devices deeply integrated into the physical world. 
Driven by the explosion of IoT devices and advances in edge-cloud computing, these systems represent a transformative phase in information technology. 
The work focuses on the engineering challenges unique to CPSWs, 
 particularly in managing the complexities arising from their collective intelligence and large-scale nature. 
 To tackle these issues, a language-based approach centred on aggregate computing is introduced. 
 This programming model is well-suited for designing self-organizing behaviours, 
 which are crucial for the efficient and resilient operation of large-scale CPSWs. 
 The thesis makes significant contributions in both hybrid and standard engineering approaches. 
 It offers a comprehensive roadmap for integrating machine learning with aggregate computing, 
 proposes new algorithms for robust self-organization, and introduces novel tools and architectures tailored for CPSWs. 
 The research aims to provide a holistic framework for the effective engineering and deployment of large-scale, adaptable, and robust CPSWs.
