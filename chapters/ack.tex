I always told myself that I would write these acknowledgements only at the end of my academic journey.
 However, it seems I may never want to leave this world, 
 so the time has come to thank all the dear people who have been with me throughout this long journey. 
 I want to emphasize that whatever I am, have done, and will do, is all thanks to you: 
 I have merely done what needed to be done, and you have been my guide. 
 I am endlessly grateful to you all.

First and foremost, 
 I must thank my family for always standing by me, 
 even when it seemed like I was lost. 
 In particular, I want to thank my mom for teaching me what it means to love, 
 my dad for showing me the meaning of dedication and sacrifice, 
 and my grandparents—grandpa Giuseppe for his kindness and grandma Rosa for her boundless dedication to work, for the meals prepared, and for her zest for life. 
 A special thanks go to my older brother Cristiano; 
 one of the most brilliant people I know.
 He always encouraged me to do my best and to never give up, 
 he has been a shining star in my darker moments—you are the best, keep it up!

I would also like to thank my lifelong friends, 
 Giovanni, Cri, and Sonia. 
 They have seen so many versions of me and still accept me--I do not know how they manage! 
 You have been by my side in tough times, providing lightness, and for that, I sincerely thank you. 
 I hope you continue to tolerate my craziness.

A special thanks go to Mone and Pedro who made me feel at home and believed in me during my university years--you are like brothers to me! 
%
A note of gratitude also goes to Jo, 
 my roommate for these last few months, 
 for helping me through difficult times--I apologize for all the therapy sessions you have had to endure!
%
Last but not least, I want to thank Marta--my muse and my reference point for so many years. 
 Much of who I am today is thanks to her. 
 I am still not as radiant as I would like to be,
 but some of the light I do have comes from the years spent with her. 
 Thank you for everything.
%
A special thanks to my second family, the Luffarelli--thank you for loving me as a son. 
 You will forever be in my heart.
%
In closing, 
 I extend my heartfelt thanks to a multitude of extraordinary people who have crossed my path. 
 From my formative years in academia to the rough final months of my doctoral journey, 
 each one of you has left an enduring impact on my life. 
 I earnestly hope that, in some small way, I have been able to enhance your lives 
 as you have so profoundly enriched mine.

Turning to the scientific side, 
 I want to express my boundless gratitude to my three main mentors: Mirko, Roberto, and Danilo. 
 To you, I want to say, ``having access to people smarter than yourself is a blessing.'' 
% 
Mirko exemplifies the kind of professor people aspire to be--his dedication, love for his work, 
 and ongoing enthusiasm have always pushed me to give my best, because ``there are no alternatives to excellence''. 
 Roberto has been a reference for my work since my bachelor's thesis, 
 he is for me like a lighthouse guiding me through stormy seas--his advice, work ethic, and endless abilities are something I have always aspired to. 
 A special thank you to Danilo, 
 who has given me so much not just technically and scientifically 
 but also encouraged me to be a better version of myself (in his atypical methods).
 Additionally, I extend another heartfelt thank you to him. The cohesive group of researchers in Cesena exists primarily due to his unconventional efforts (e.g., the mandatory Friday Sthop).
%
Special mentions go to Alessandro Ricci for his dedication to teaching and his endless curiosity, 
 and to Giovanni Ciatto, who despite his outward cynicism, shows rare love for his work and displays a humanity hard to find in academia. 
 My only regret is that he beats me badly at Mario Kart.
%
I would also like to thank my students, especially Angelo, Francesco, and Giacomo. 
 You have taught me much more than I have imparted to you--I hope I've shared some of my joy for this work and given you some valuable guidance.
%
Further, thanks go to my first office colleagues, Angelo and Sara, who were my go-to people in the initial dark months related to COVID of my PhD at our PS Lab.
%
I also must thank all my Area 4.0 companions—I promise to continue making coffee even when I sometimes go crazy.
%
Thank you to Lukas Esterle for hosting me in Aarhus and guiding me attentively. 
Moreover, during my time abroad, I felt at home thanks to all my dormitory colleagues. 
You made those three beautiful months better.

With this, 
 I conclude this lengthy section of acknowledgements, 
 which has been particularly challenging for me to write given my good fortune in encountering so many extraordinary individuals who have enriched my environment. So, thank you all. 
 I will continue to navigate this insane journey, knowing that I can always rely on you.
